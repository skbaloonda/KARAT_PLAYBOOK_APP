The Senior level evaluates frontend focused System Design and uses a single scenario to probe into many areas, including accessibility. Both levels share a frontend coding assessment, which requires improving a page layout, debugging, and adding functionality to an existing codebase in both HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. Frontend development focuses on UI/UX development languages and frameworks. It is intended for engineers that have focused their software skill around User Interfaces and customer experience.

At Mid-level the assessment includes a dedicated probe into accessible development through a presented scenario with accessibility flaws to identify, and continues to platform-specific (iOS and Android) discussion questions. At the senior level, accessibility is one component evaluated as part of an in-depth Whiteboard System Design exercise where designs are expected to function cross-platform. The GCB4 Mobile Developer assessment requires an understanding of the mobile landscape across iOS and Android development frameworks. 50% of the assessment is real world coding on a mobile platform. GCB5 engineering includes questions on accessibility and good design but is predominantly coding. The GCB4 coding is focused on either iOS and Android environments and engineers are not expected to have a broad understanding of the other platform.</td>
